# cfworkyworker
middleware

made fasty-fasty but does its work (kinda replaces WARP but with some pros and some cons) no SOTA here but an idea

you can host workers for free (i guess?? but so do i) and get the free personal thing

if workers.dev blocked in your area you can add your very own domain if you have one and use it (havent tried it with [freedns](https://freedns.afraid.org/) tho)
